- This repository is for CV, because this project is on process and have not submitted to our teacher, so i can't public the source of that repository in case of someone stole it, and my teacher give us the 0 point. Sorry about that.
- This project is using : GIPHY Api, Firebase storage, Websocket, HTML, SCSS, Typescript and angular framework
go to appchat folder and open command line :"npm install", then "ng serve" to run this project
- If you can't login, that's because the websocket is closed by my teacher.
Thanks !
